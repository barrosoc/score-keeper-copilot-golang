## Problem Description

We need software to deliver the proper data to the scoreboard for a basketball team. Unfortunately the people using our
software are not the brightest lights under the sun, so they need six buttons (each team can score either 1, 2 or 3 
points with a single shot).

## Task

Write a class ScoreKeeper which offers following methods:

```go
scoreTeamA1()
scoreTeamA2()
scoreTeamA3()
scoreTeamB1()
scoreTeamB2()
scoreTeamB3()
getScore()
```

## Rules

The returned String always has seven characters. An example would be 000:000
